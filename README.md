# ArchPatches

Here you can find my personal patches to make some tools better suited for my
personal workflow: Making them more `vim`-like and turn the background to `base3`
from the solarized color palette.

The PKGBUILD scripts are pulled from the AUR and have only been adapted to
include my patches.
